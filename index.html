            <p>
                In this project, I created sketches, lo-fi, and hi-fi designs
                for the LetterBoxd app. Then, I developed this redesign with
                HTML and CSS.

                <h3>Picking a Webpage</h3>
                <p>
                    The website that I'm redesigning is the “Reviews Page” from
                    Letterboxd, a social media platform where users rate and
                    comment on movies and TV shows for their friends to see. See
                    full website
                    <a
                        href="https://letterboxd.com/jbenzon/film/turning-red/"
                        target="_blank"

                    >!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose this website, because I feel it's outdated and
                    confusing to navigate, as there’s a lot of visual elements
                    that are catching my attention and not highlighting the most
                    important elements when I’m reading a review section.

                <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, I analyzed the problems with the application's
                    interface by creating an infographic with annotations of the
                    elements and writing a list about its Learnability,
                    Memorability, and Efficiency.
                </p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img
                        src="./reports/Design Critiques.png"
                        alt="Design Critiques of Letterboxd"
                    />
                    <p class="caption">
                        Here are the main issues with the interface.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="bullets">
                    <h4>Learnability:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Text for different links (rather than icons is
                            helpful), but feels too cluttered and even
                            overwhelming for new users
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hover states only show two icons, but most users
                            want it to put it in a list, so it’s hard for users
                            to know how to add to a list since there’s no quick
                            icon to go to
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Friend (or other) reviews aren’t shown immediately
                            unless users click on each friend icon
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Memorability:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Workflow is similar to DVD stands “RedBox” and
                            “BlockBuster,” as shape and grid display is familiar
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Review ratings and comments is similar to most movie
                            review and social media comment sections with the 5
                            star rating system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Reviewed,” “Like,” and “Watchlist” icons feel that
                            they’re all similar, and users can hesitate on what
                            to categorize the movie, since they’re all the same
                            size
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Efficiency:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bigger buttons are displayed for writing reviews and
                            editing their star ratings
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Logic of tags being at the bottom and the rating and
                            commentary being first is more efficient, as most
                            important content is being showed first from top to
                            bottom
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adding comments is confusing, as there are multiple
                            “steps” to actually put and type a comment (click on
                            review, click on small icon, enter comment section
                            as a whole new page, click empty text field, enter
                            comment)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, I first used "WebAIM WAVE" to detect possible
                    accessibility problems. However, it wasn't able to generate
                    a report, so I reverted to using "Lighthouse" instead. The
                    score came back with a score of <span>87/100</span>.
                </p>

                <div class="bullets">
                    <h4>Main Issues:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Background and foreground colors do not have a
                            sufficient contrast ratio

                            redundant text
                        </li>

                <p>
                    Based on the findings, I mostly agree with the accessibility
                    problems raised from the report. A lot of the icons (search
                    icon, calendar icons, etc.) don’t have descriptive text on
                    hover or as an “aria-label.” Likewise, I also found some of
                    the issues about color contrast accessibility to be
                    interesting, because from my point of view, the contrast
                    looks legible; however, it’s important to note for users who
                    have visual limitations are affected.
